 * its about manipulation of g.
 * 
 * with g = 1, session key would always be 1
 * with g = p, session key would always be 0
 * with g = p-1, session key would be 0 if p is a odd number & session key would be 1 if p is even number
 * 
 * need to refer some other implementation to see if I am missing something here. That has to be done later!
